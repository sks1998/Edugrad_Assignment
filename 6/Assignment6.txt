1) Write a Python program to convert a list of numeric value into a one-dimensional NumPy array.

2) Create a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from 2 to 10.

3) Write a Python program to reverse an array (first element becomes last).

4) Write a Python program to append values to the end of an array.(Use Numpy append() method )

5) Find indices of non-zero elements from [1,2,0,0,4,0]

6) Create a null vector of size 10

7) Create a null vector of size 10 but the fifth value which is 1

8) Create a random vector of size 10 and sort it

9) Subtract the mean of each row of a matrix

10) Create a histogram using Numpy for the following data 1,2,1,3,4,,5,1,3,4,1,2,3,5,4,1,2,3,4,1,3,2

with the bin range bins=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Also use matplotlib to visualize the histogram.
